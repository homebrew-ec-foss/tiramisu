## But what is FOSS?

In contrast to proprietary software, <span style="color:#00fb6b; font-style:italic;">Free and Open Source Software</span> or FOSS is open for all to study, use, modify and redistribute under an open-source license. A good example is <a href="https://github.com/anna-ssg/anna">anna</a>, a lightning-fast static site generator developed by our members that powers this very website! ⚡

To learn more about FOSS, check out <a href="https://homebrew.hsp-ec.xyz">Homebrew</a> - our very own FOSS wing that's open to all open-source enthusiasts! ♥️
